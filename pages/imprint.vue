        <p class="text-lg">Liability for Content</p>

        <p class="text-sec mb-4">The contents of our website have been created with the greatest possible care. However, we
            cannot guarantee the
            contents' accuracy, completeness, or topicality. According to Section 7, paragraph 1 of the TMG
            (Telemediengesetz -
            German Telemedia Act), we as service providers are liable for our content on these pages by general laws.
            However,
            according to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, we service providers are not obliged to monitor external information
            transmitted or stored or investigate circumstances pointing to illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block
            the
            use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, a liability in this regard is only possible
            from
            the moment of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the
            content
            immediately.</p>

        <p class="text-lg">Liability for Links</p>

        <p class="text-sec mb-4">Our website contains links to external websites, over whose contents we have no control.
            Therefore, we cannot accept
            any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the websites is always
            responsible
            for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
            linking. Illegal contents were not identified at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the
            contents
            of the linked pages is not reasonable without specific indications of a violation. Upon notification of
            violations,
            we will remove such links immediately.</p>

        <p class="text-lg">Copyright</p>

        <p class="text-sec mb-4">The contents and works on these pages created by the site operator are subject to German
            copyright law. The
            duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of utilization outside the limits of copyright require the
            written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for
            private, non-commercial use. In so far as the contents on this site were not created by the operator, the

            a
            copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such
            contents
            immediately.</p>
